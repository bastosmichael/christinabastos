# About Me

## Hello fellow Hutto Hippos! 

My name is Christina, I am a homeschooling mother of 4 with a passion for serving our community and neighborhood. As vice chair of the Charter review commission and a Parks Advisory Board member, I have put down roots that I cherish. I absolutely LOVE Hutto and am so excited to run for City Council. With your help, I would love to be a part of the new chapter in Hutto's growth and success. 

Hutto has certainly had some growing pains but I truly believe that a slow and steady pace for future development will allow Hutto to become a force to be reckoned with! 

I also want to be a part of the conversation as to where our city is headed. I want to foster and preserve the hometown feel and downtown charm so we can welcome new small businesses to the area and help support the small businesses that call Hutto home. This year has been tough on everyone but I am hopeful that with the support of the amazing residents we have, our small businesses will come back stronger than ever. 

I strongly support the preservation of our town's history and will work to showcase the hard work and dedication of those who have made Hutto the world's premier place to go Hippo hunting! It's time to look at what has worked well for Hutto and what hasn't worked so well. 

Hutto is primed for a huge comeback. With new leadership and a more transparent and open City Council, we are well underway towards an amazing time to be a resident of Hutto. 

I am available to anyone who has suggestions, questions or insight. I want only to serve as a voice for you.

### Thank you and God bless!
